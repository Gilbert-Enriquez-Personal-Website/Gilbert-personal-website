    <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the projects that I have done.</p>

    <h2>Grocery List</h2>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>This is a grocery list that I had organized by making a ordered and unordered list. I then add a visual picture to show what items the list is asking for to be more clear. I also used css coding file linked to my html file to create different styles throughout the page</p>
        
        <h3>Secure The Vault</h3>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>In this project I created a html that sends an alert to the user about opening up a vault with a few combination codes that I generated using javascript coding linked to the html file. </p>

        <h4>The Zoo Problem</h4>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>I was task to create an html broswer page that provides information to the zookeepers about the animals they are looking after. I included images as well as other hyperlinks for them to use for resource to get any information they need about the animals.</p>
