    <h2>Here are some hobbies and interests that I have when I am not on the job.</h2>
    
    <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>I enjoy playing video games either on consoles or a PC. I enjoy different types of game from single adventure to co-op/multiplayer games. I mostly play Destiny 2 with some of my coworkers every Sunday in the evening. Some times we all can't be on, so when that happens I just play solo or join up with random players. </p>
    
        <h4>Mixed Martial Arts(MMA)</h4>
        <p>I used to train mixed martial arts about 8-10 years ago. I haven't trained since then but I am still a big fan of it. I also enjoy watch MMA fights like the UFC, ONE FC, Bellator. Some people only see violence but there is an art behind it and it does teaches dicipline and respect. Even though the fighters can be a bit disrespectful some times. I hope to start training again soon to keep myself in good shape and to be able to defend myself if I even need to.</p>
    
    <h5>Dancing</h5>
    <p>I love to dance and have a good time when I am at a party or music festival. I am currently obessed with rave festivals. I used to shuffle in high school and can still do it now. Not as good as I did in high school though. I am planning on practicing again so that way the next event I go to I can feel more confident while shuffling. I enjoy dancing to other music too besides the EDM genre.</p>
