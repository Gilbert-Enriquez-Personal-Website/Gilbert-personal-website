    <h2>Here are some hobbies and interests that I have when I am not on the job.</h2>
    
    <h3>Gaming</h3>

        <p>I enjoy playing video games either on consoles or a PC. I enjoy different types of game from single adventure to co-op/multiplayer games. I mostly play Destiny 2 with some of my coworkers every Sunday in the evening. Some times we all can't be on, so when that happens I just play solo or join up with random players. </p>
    
        <h4>Mixed Martial Arts(MMA)</h4>

        <p>I used to train mixed martial arts about 8-10 years ago. I haven't trained since then but I am still a big fan of it. I also enjoy watch MMA fights like the UFC, ONE FC, Bellator. Some people only see violence but there is an art behind it and it does teaches dicipline and respect. I also enjoy seeing the amount of stuggle these fighters overcome and conqure through persistance and dedication.</p>
    
    <h5>Dancing</h5>

    <p>I love to dance and have a good time when I am at a party or music festival. I enjoy learning new dances and showing what I am made of on the dance floor.</p>
